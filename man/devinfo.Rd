A structure containing graphical parameters

This is how graphical parameters are passed from graphics systems
to the graphics engine AND from the graphics engine to graphics
devices.

Devices are not *required* to honour graphical parameters
(e.g., alpha transparency is going to be tough for some)






Information about the \code{device description} list (\code{dd})

The structure is passed from C++ to the user callback function.

It can also be returned to the C++ code.

The C++ header file which defines this is: src/include/R_ext/GraphicsDevice.h
